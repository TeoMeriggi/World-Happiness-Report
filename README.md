# World-Happiness-Report
The project is based on the World Happiness Report, published every year by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
# Project Summary
The report consists of articles, rankings, and data on National Happiness, which have been collected from more than 150 countries. The study spans from 2005 to 2025 and encompasses multiple factors that influence a country's Happiness Score and overall well-being.
# Analysis Criteria
In this project, I have performed the following analyses:

1. Exploratory analysis: I utilized various visualization techniques such as scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and categorical plots to gain insights and explore the data.
2. Geospatial analysis: I incorporated a shapefile to conduct analysis and examine geographic patterns and relationships within the data.
3. Regression analysis: I employed regression techniques to identify and understand the relationships between variables in the data.
4. Cluster analysis: I applied cluster analysis methods to identify groups or clusters within the data based on similarities or patterns.
5. Time-series analysis: I conducted an analysis that focused on examining trends and patterns over time in the data.
6. Analysis narrative and final results: I created a dashboard to present the analysis narrative
